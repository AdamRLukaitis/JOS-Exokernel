Lab 3A
------
1)
If we only had 1 handler, we would not be able to distinguish between the two cases where we may or
may not have an error code pushed onto the stack. Since we want the structure of the trap frame to be
consistent for both cases, we need a different version of the handler that puts a 0 in that position 
when there is no error code pushed.

2)
Since we are in user mode where CPL is 3, there is not sufficient privilege to enter the gate which 
has DPL of 0 (to enter: CPL <= DPL). Instead we get the general protection fault which captures 
all faults not captured by the current gates in the IDT. If it is allowed into vector 14, nothing will
happen as of now because have not set up the trap dispatcher to call the page fault handler function.

Lab 3B
------
3)
The general protection fault is caused by the breakpoint gate in IDT setting to privilege level 0. Since
we are entering the breakpoint trap from user mode (privilege level 3), this will cause a general protection
fault because we don't have sufficient privileges. Once we change the IDT privilege level to 3, the user
enters without triggering a protection fault and triggers the breakpoint trap that we wanted. 

4)
We have these protection mechanisms in place to prevent or allow users to access specific trap gates.
For example, the softint user program attempts to trigger a page fault from user space, which is not allowed.
Since the page fault gate (14) is set to only allow entrance from privilege level 0, a general protection
fault is triggered instead. This will protect the kernel from any malicious attacks from user processes.
