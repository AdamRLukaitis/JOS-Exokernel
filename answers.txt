1.
If we only had 1 handler, we would not be able to distinguish between the two cases where we may or
may not have an error code pushed onto the stack. Since we want the structure of the trap frame to be
consistent for both cases, we need a different version of the handler that puts a 0 in that position 
when there is no error code pushed.

2.
Since we are in user mode where CPL is 3, there is not sufficient privilege to enter the gate which 
has DPL of 0 (to enter: CPL <= DPL). Instead we get the general protection fault which captures 
all faults not captured by the current gates in the IDT. If it is allowed into vector 14, nothing will
happen as of now because have not set up the trap dispatcher to call the page fault handler function.
