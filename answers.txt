Currently my implementation is that if the transmit ring is full, meaning that the next index after tail is the head
but the DD bit shows that it's not been processed yet, the transmit packet function will simply return an error number
indicating that the packet is dropped. However, in output() if the return of the packet send system call indicates that
packet is dropped, it will yield and try resending the same packet again until it succeeds before fetching the next packet.
