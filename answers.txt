No. Because the eflags register is pushed onto the stack whenever we do a context switch or trap
into the kernel. When we return back to this environment, the saved setting of the IOPL mask will 
be popped back off the trap frame and restored into the eflags register, so our setting is never lost.

Challenge:
For the challenge problem, I implemented an auto tab completion feature for the shell. When the user
is in the middle of typing a command and press tab, the readlines() function havew been modified such
that it will search for a possible match to the current typed command. A list of pre-defined commands
has been given and can be expanded if more commands are available. When a similar match has been
found, tab_autocmpl() in readlines.c autocompletes the rest of the command for the user. This could 
also be used in multiple commands inputted on the same line.
