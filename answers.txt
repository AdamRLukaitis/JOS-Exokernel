1)
When the BP runs boot.S, the linker encoded link addresses of variables into the binary to be the same
as where it was actually loaded into memory. In other words, the link address is equal to load address
because it was specified in the elf. However, when the AP is running, the linker did not set up those 
link addresses correctly with respect to where it was actually loaded (at MPENTRY_PADDR). The link and
load addresses are different. Therefore, the AP have to compute the addresses of variables used in 
mpentry.S directly using macro MPBOOTPHYS. If we did not have the macro the memory references would 
refer to some other place in memory that we do not want.
